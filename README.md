## Overview

This app provides a directory, accessible via ssh of sftp, to a new user.

A "chroot jail" limits the commands the user can use, so you can rest assured that
they can't access your server's contents outside of the provided directory.

A data size quota is also set on the directory.


**Shipped version:** 1.3~ynh3
